# PC-BASED-DATA-ACQUISITION-SYSTEM-WITH-FAULT-ALERTS
This project demonstrates a PC-based Data Acquisition System built using the LPC2148 microcontroller to monitor and log temperature data from an LM35 sensor. The system includes real-time temperature tracking, timestamped logging, and a fault alert mechanism that records alerts when the temperature exceeds a set threshold.
